    📝 Understanding Passive Voice and Gerunds
1. Passive Voice
Passive voice is used when the subject receives the action instead of doing it.

📌 Structure:
[Subject] + [form of "be"] + [past participle] (+ by [agent])

✅ Examples:
Active: The chef cooks the meal.

Passive: The meal is cooked (by the chef).

Active: They will finish the project.

Passive: The project will be finished (by them).

🔍 Tips:
Use passive voice when who did the action is unknown or unimportant.

Focus is on the result or object, not the doer.
